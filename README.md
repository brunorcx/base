# Creation of a complete E-commerce website using Nodejs, Javascript and Typescript. 
MongoDB Atlas will store user, customer and product data. Image in the other end is stored in Amazom S3 Cloud, which will generate a URL that will be stored in MongoDB. Its interface was made with React, HTML and CSS.

*PS1: Current URL points to the interface. The API is located at: https://github.com/Machado21/node*

*PS2: We are working to host the site on the Vercel platform to make it available to use. The URL will be informed soon.*

*PS3: Issue and bugs management is done by the boards in Gitlab and not in Github. You can access the project at: https://gitlab.com/brunorcx/base*
